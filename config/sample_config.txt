# Sample configuration file for evcouplings monomer protein prediction pipeline.
# This file determines all aspects of the computation:
# - which compute environment to use
# - which stages of the pipeline to run
# - what the settings for each of the stages are

# Minimal settings required before this configuration can be executed:
# - set your environment, paths to tools and databases (at the end of this file)
# - under "global", set prefix and sequence_id
# - run it! :)

# Configuration rules:
# 1) Global settings override settings for stages
# 2) Outputs of a stage are merged into "global" and fed into the input of subsequent stages
#    (e.g., the alignment_file output of align will be used by the alignment_file input of couplings)
# 3) All settings are explicitly specified here. No hidden defaults in code.
# 4) Each stage is also passed the parameters in the "databases" and "tools" sections
